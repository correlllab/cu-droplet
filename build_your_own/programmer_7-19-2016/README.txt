This board is used to connect a Droplet to the programmer (Simply connect PDI and power)

Note that we haven't actually gotten this built as a proper circuit board, the way it is presented here.

This schematic is based on a prototype I made in-lab.
Thus, we can't guarantee that this design should work.

Good luck!
