## Global Settings/Symbols  
  These are located at the top of (../include/droplet_base.h).
    
  __AUDIO_DROPLET__  
    Should only be #define'd if you are programming an Audio Droplet.
    
  __SYNCHRONIZED__  
      If this is #define'd here, it will turn on the firefly synchronization subsystem.
      At the cost of each Droplet sending a very short message every few seconds, the Droplets will have their real time clocks synchronized such that, if they all have code to perform some action at, for example, `get_time()%1000`, they will all do that action simultaneously.

## General Guidelines  
  Due primarily to memory limitations, I strongly encourage you to use the size-explicit
  data types provided, as you will see throughout the Droplets code:  `uint8_t`, `int8_t`, `uint16_t`, `int16_t`, `uint32_t`, `int32_t`

## Debugging & `printf`
  If you have an FTDI cable set up with a serial connection to a Droplet, you can talk to it! See (../../getting_started.md)  for details on getting there.
  The Droplet will respond to the commands listed in (../src/serial_handler.c), and you can add your own commands by uncommenting and populating the user_handle_command function seen in the template code. Everything up to the first space character is considered the command_word, and everything after that is considered the command_args. You can use the code in serial_handler.c as a template for writing your own command handlers. Remember that the string library expects (and gives) null-terminated strings. 
  Be sure that user_handle_command returns 1 if the command_word is valid, and 0 otherwise.

  To have a Droplet talk back to you, use printf! It works as normal, but is much more sensitive to format chars than normal C. More specifically: all of the variables in your format string for printf will total a certain number of bytes. If the arguments you pass printf after the format string do not add up to the correct number of bytes, it can cause insidious stack-corruption bugs. Most commonly, this occurs when a variable is, say, 8 bits long and your format string specifices a two-byte-long type. 
  
  Brief primer on format strings for the different types:  
    `%[C1]{C2}`  
    `C1`  
      Optional. If not included, indicates the default size for the type specific by C2. For ints, both signed and unsigned, the default size is two bytes. If 'h', size is one byte. If 'l', size is 4 bytes.        
    `C2`  
      Indicates the variable type.  
        `%d` : signed int  
        `%u` : unsigned int  
        `%f` : float  
        `%x` : lower-case hex  
        `%X` : upper-case hex  
    (So use `%hu` for a `uint8_t`, `%ld` for an `int32_t`, `%u` for a `uint16_t`, and `%f` for a `float`).
    
    Note: For consistency with Droplets' labels, I strongly recommend you always print out Droplet IDs with `%04X`.

  Also: you may see printf_P(PSTR("some format string"), ...) in the code. This changes the printf to store the string argument in program memory instead of data memory, since the former is much more spacious. In general, users shouldn't need to worry about this, but if your code gets long and complex, and you start running low on memory, it can help to do this yourself.

## Functions

### Communication
  These two functions are used for communicating with other Droplets. If these functions return '0', it means that your message did not get sent, probably because the ir equipment in at least one of the directions you wanted to send in was still busy sending the previous message you asked to be sent. Otherwise it returns '1'.

  `dir_mask`  
    A dir_mask as described in the IR Directions section at the bottom of this document. If you don't know what direction you want to communicate in, you should use `ALL_DIRS`.
  `data`  
    A char array which contains the message to be sent. Need not be null terminated.  
  `data_length`  
    The number of chars in data. (ie, the size of the array). This should not be greater than 40.  
  `target`
    The ID of the Droplet the message is targeted to. Only that Droplet will get this message.  

  Messages always have an eight-byte header, and take about 2.5ms per byte.  Thus, if your message's data length is 1, the message will take about 23ms. If its data length is 40, it will take about 120ms.
  
```C
uint8_t ir_send(uint8_t dir_mask, char* data, uint8_t data_length);
uint8_t ir_targeted_send(uint8_t dir_mask, char *data, uint16_t data_length, id_t target);
```

### Light
  These functions set the intensity of the red, green, and blue LEDs respectively.
  '0' turns an LED off, '255' is full brightness.
```C
void set_red_led(uint8_t intensity); 
void set_green_led(uint8_t intensity);
void set_blue_led(uint8_t intensity);
```

  This function simply calls the three functions above with the values passed it. If r=g=b, the light will be white.
```C
void set_rgb(uint8_t r, uint8_t g, uint8_t b);
```

   This function simply calls set_rgb, after performing a color conversion from hsv color space to rgb color space. For more information on HSV color space, see: (http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV)  
       h : The hue. Should be between 0 and 360.  
       s : Saturation. Should be between 0 (0%) and 255 (100%)  
       v :  Value, or Brightness. Should be beteen 0 (0%) and 255 (100%)
```C
void set_hsv(uint16_t h, uint8_t s, uint8_t v);
```

  These functions are used to get the intensity that the red, green, or blue LED is currently set to.
```C 
uint8_t get_red_led(void);
uint8_t get_green_led(void);
uint8_t get_blue_led(void);
```

### Color Sensing.
  This function returns the sensed red, green, and blue values. It is pass by reference: you should pass pointers to `int16_t`'s where thecolor measurement will be stored. For example:
```C
void get_rgb(int16_t* r, int16_t* g, int16_t* b);
```
For Example:
```C
  int16_t r,g,b;
  get_rgb(&r, &g, &b);
 ```

### Range and Bearing
```C
void broadcast_rnb_data(void); 
```
  'rnb' is short for 'range and bearing', and getting this data is made a little bit more complicated because it requires two Droplets to do something in unison (one turning its IR lights on, the other making measurements). When you call broadcast_rnb_data() on a Droplet, it causes the Droplet do perform what we call an rnb broadcast: a carefully timed sequence of turning on its IR lights. Before it does so, it broadcasts a message so other Droplets know that this is going to happen. (If you call ir_send right before broadcast_rnb_data, the thing you tried to send probably won't get out because broadcast_rnb_data will stomp all over your message) As a result of the rnb broadcast, every other Droplet nearby will get new measurements of range, bearing, and heading for the Droplet which performed the broadcast. In general, the 'standard' way to use this system is to have every Droplet periodically call broadcast_rnb_data(). (You don't want to do this /too/ frequently. Try around every 5 seconds.) And, in every Droplet's loop(), have:
  ```C
  if(get_time() - last_rnb_time > 5000){
    broadcast_rnb_data();
    last_rnb_time = get_time();
  }
  
  if(rnb_updated){
     //new data in last_good_rnb, ie.:
     last_good_rnb.id_number;
     last_good_rnb.range;
     last_good_rnb.bearing;
     last_good_rnb.heading;
     rnb_updated = 0; //Note! This line must be included for things to work properly.
  }
  ```
  If Droplets A,B,C, and D all have this in their code, and Droplet A does an rnb broadcast, Droplets B,C, and D will all get new rnb data for Droplet A.

  Note: An rnb broadcast takes ~142ms.

### Movement
  This function has the Droplet move in the specified direction for the specific number of 'steps'. There isn't a great way to map from steps to actual distances. Try 30-100 as a starting place.
  ```C
  uint8_t	move_steps(uint8_t direction, uint16_t num_steps);
  ```

  Droplets can be calibrated for how far they move each step. If they have been, this function lets you specify how far you want the robot to move and converts the distance in mm to a number of steps.
  ```C 
  void walk(uint8_t direction, uint16_t mm);
  ```

  This function has the Droplet stop all movement.
  ```C
  void stop_move(void);
  ```
  This function returns '-1' (NOT '0') if the Droplet is not moving, and otherwise returns the direction the Droplet is moving in.
  ```C
  int8_t is_moving(void);
  ```
  
### Power
  The functions below can be used to check power levels on each leg, and on the capacitor.
  ```C
  uint8_t cap_status(void);
  int8_t leg_status(uint8_t leg);
  uint8_t legs_powered(void);
  ```

### Utilities
  These functions return random values:
  ```C
  uint8_t  rand_byte(void);  //from 0 to 255
  uint16_t rand_short(void); //from 0 to 65535
  uint32_t rand_quad(void);  //from 0 to 4294967295
  float    rand_real(void);  //from 0.0 to 1.0
  float    rand_norm(float mean, float stdDev); //normally-distributed random value with the specified properties.
  ```
  
  Every droplet has a unique, sixteen-bit ID number.
  This function returns the ID number of the Droplet which calls it.
  ```C
  id_t get_droplet_id(void);
  ```
  
  Restart the Droplet:
  ```C
  void droplet_reboot(void);
  ```
  
### Time
  ```C
  void delay_ms(uint16_t ms).
  uint32_t get_time(void); //returns time in ms since Droplet started.
  ```
  
  schedule_task causes the Droplet to call the specified function, time milliseconds from now.
  ```C
  volatile Task_t* schedule_task(uint32_t time, flex_function function, void* arg);
  ```

## IR Directions
  For several different IR functions, we use a 'dir mask', a single byte (ie, uint8_t) which can mark each of the six directions as 'on' or 'off'. A few values are defined in the code to make using these dir_masks easier. There is a direction for each set of IR hardware. To help describe each direction unambiguously, imagine the top of a Droplet as a 12-hour clock face, with the arrow on the shell at 12 o'clock. With this, each direction has the hour position on the clock which corresponds with that direction.

| Dir Name  | Binary     | Hex  |
|:---------:|:----------:|:----:|
| DIR0      | 0b00000001 | 0x01 |
| DIR1      | 0b00000010 | 0x02 |
| DIR2      | 0b00000100 | 0x04 |
| DIR3      | 0b00001000 | 0x08 |
| DIR4      | 0b00010000 | 0x10 |
| DIR5      | 0b00100000 | 0x20 |
| ALL_DIRS  | 0b00111111 | 0x3F |
  ```
       _--------_
     /            \
    /DIR5     DIR0 \
   /                \
  | DIR4        DIR1 |
   \    	           /
    \DIR3      DIR2/
     \            /
       -_________-
  ```
  If you wanted a dir mask for directions 1 and 4, say, you could just write `(DIR1|DIR4)`.

## Motor Directions
  Unfortunately, the directions for this function are different than for the IR stuff. We didn't do this out of spite, but the directions are determined by where the legs and motors are positioned. This time, the direction is just a number (no fancy binary stuff, since the Droplet can only move in one direction at a time). Directions 0-5 are walking straight in a certain direction. Direction 6 is clockwise rotation. Direction 7 is counterclockwise rotation. Referring to a clock face as we did for the IR directions, we have:
  ```
        direction 0: 12 o'clock (forward)
        direction 1: 2 o'clock
        direction 2: 4 o'clock
        direction 3: 6 o'clock (backward)
        direction 4: 8 o'clock
        direction 5: 10 o'clock
  ```
  Note that, since one of their motors has been replaced with a speaker, Audio Droplets can only move in directions 0, 3, 6, and 7. They don't break if you tell them to move in direction 1, they just don't do anything.
