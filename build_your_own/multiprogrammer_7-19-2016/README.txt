This board can be used to program 12 Droplets at once (Simply connect PDI and power)

Note that we haven't actually gotten this built as a proper circuit board, the way it is presented here.

This schematic is based on a prototype I made in-lab out of laser-cut acrylic, hot glue, wires, and solder.
Thus, we can't guarantee that this design should work.

Good luck!
