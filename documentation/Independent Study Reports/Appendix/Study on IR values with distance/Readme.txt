This folder contains two files:

1. IR collision values with distance contains the droplet ID and the raw IR value obtained from 
various IR emitter pairs at different distances. The surface from which these values were measured was
a stationary white box. The baselines at the start of the experiment and when updated periodically are noted in 
the file as well.

2. IR collision values 2 contains the same data as above, but instead of the uniform white surface, another
droplet was used in its place and the white and the black surfaces of the stationary droplet were used to measure the
IR values and measure how much they varied with distance.
