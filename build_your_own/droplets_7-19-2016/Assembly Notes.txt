Be sure that all of the IR emitters and sensors are oriented so the green mark
is on the left from the perspective of an observer on the center of the board.
Compared to the previous assembly, the IR Emitters (white, on top) were WRONG.
IR Sensors (black, on bottom) were correct.

The IR Receivers need to be pushed all the way in to their holes; they should be
flush with the IR sensor beneath them.
