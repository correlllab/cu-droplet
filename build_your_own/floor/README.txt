These are the files for the Droplets floor. We ordered this from goldphoenixpcb, but they made a few small but crucial changes.

For optimal results, make sure that the spaces between the strips are filled with solder mask 
(or something) -- this ensures that the top surface is as flat as possible.

Also you want the exposed contacts to not just be copper, but we had a hard time finding a
manufacturer who could make a board this big with a silver-colored coating. We've been able to make
do with raw copper but it does get tarnished.

Depending on how many Droplets you're trying to power at once, you may need to add more parallel paths for power.

If you want a smaller floor just scale the design - only key element is the width of each strip/gaps between the strips.
