NOTE: These instructions are specific to the Windows operating system. All hardware referenced is simply the hardware we use.
Now that we have a custom Makefile, it shouldn't be too hard to get up and running on a different OS, though I'm sure there are a few extra steps that will be needed.

#### Physical Supplies
* A PDI programmer. We use the <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/ATATMEL-ICE/ATATMEL-ICE-ND/4753379">JTAGICE3</a>.
* (Optional, for serial communication) FTDI Cable. We use those available on <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9718">sparkfun</a> with a minor modication (described below).

#### Software Supplies
* The latest version of <a href="http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelstudio.aspx">Atmel Studio</a>.
  * This should also install the USB drivers for the PDI programmer, which are needed.
* This repo! Clone a copy to your local machine.
* (Optional, for serial communication) <a href="http://ttssh2.sourceforge.jp/index.html.en">Tera Term</a>, or any other serial program.
* (Optional, for serial communication) FTDI Drivers for the cable. The sparkfun product page linked above has links for these. IMPORTANT: Be sure to install the drivers before plugging a cable in. We have had occasional issues with the drivers if you plug them in yourself.

#### Setup

1. Once Atmel Studio is installed, plug your JTAGICE3 programmer in to the computer (since the drivers were just installed, it should be recognized), then open Atmel Studio. It should open to a 'start page'. Near the top-left of this page is a 'New Project...' button. Click that, which should open a dialog. 

2. In this dialog, you should name your project and select a location for it to be stored. The middle of the dialog should have a list of project types. Choose 'GCC C Executable Project'. The bottom of this dialog lets you choose a project name and location on disk. Whatever you prefer is fine. and click 'OK'. This should open a 'Device Selection' dialog. You want to select the device with name 'ATxmega128A3U'. Now, your peojct should be created. 

3. Atmel Studio wiill start your project off with a \<Project Name\>.c file. Go ahead and delete it.

4. Next, we need to set up the project with the appropriate file structure.  
   1. In the 'Solution Explorer' sidebar, right-click on '\<Project Name\>->Add->New Folder', and make a folder called 'src'.
   2. Repeat the above to make another folder called 'include'.
   3. In the same sidebar, right-click on the src folder you just created and go to 'Add->Existing Item...'. This will open up a file browser, which you should use to navigate to the src folder in the repository. Specifically, cu-droplet/droplet_code/src/.
   4. *Important* Select (highlight) all files in this folder, and then click the little down-arrow on the right side of the 'Add' button, which should open a drop-down menu. In this menu, select 'Add as Link'. The reason for this is that if you just clicked 'Add', the files would be copied to the location of the project folder, and any changes you made would not be tracked by git. 
   5. Make sure that the 'src' folder in the Solution Explorer has been populated with c and s files, and that each file icon has a little 'shortcut' arrow in the bottom-right, which indicates that the file has been correctly added as a link.
   6. Repeat steps iii-v for the 'include' folder: right-click on the folder in the solution explorer of Atmel Studio, select 'Add->Existing Item...', and add all files in cu-droplet/droplet_code/include/, making sure again to add them as links.
   7. Finally, repeat steps iii-v one more time, right-clicking on '\<Project Name\>' in the solution explorer to add cu-droplet/droplet_code/user_template.* to your project as links. These are the files you will modify for your code.
  
5. Project Properties  
   1. Right-click on '\<Project Name\>' again, and select 'Properties', which opens the main dialog for editing settings. There are a lot of things you could edit in this dialog, but this document will only tell you what needs to be changed from the defaults that should have been set if you started the project correctly.
   2. 'Build' Tab  
      1. Check the 'Use External Makefile' box, then click 'Browse' and select cu-droplet/droplet_code/build/Droplets.mak
   3. 'Tool' Tab  
      1. Use the drop-down menu under 'Selected debugger/programmer' and choose the option which starts 'Atmel-ICE' (note: this option will only show up if the JTAGICE3 programmer is actually plugged in to and recognized by your machine).
      2. In the 'Interface:' drop-down menu, select 'PDI'. 
      3. Make sure that PDI Clock is set to 4MHz and, under 'Programming settings', the 'Preserve EEPROM' box is checked.
    
6. user-specific Makefile changes.
   1. Open up cu-droplet/droplet_code/build/Droplets.mak
   2. There are only three lines here you should need to modify; the first three non-comment lines.
   
      __TARGET__  
        This needs to match the name of your Atmel Studio project. 
      
      __ATMEL_STUDIO_PATH__  
        This needs to be the file path to wherever Atmel Studio is installed. 
        If Atmel Studio is installed in the default location, you shouldn't need to modify this.
      
      __USER_FILE__  
        This should be your 'main' file: the file with the 'init', 'loop', and 'handle_msg' functions.
        If you're just getting started with 'user_template.c', you shouldn't need to modify this.
        Note: This is a file path relative to the location of the makefile. Thus, '../' should be the same as 'cu-droplet/droplet_code/'
      
7. Write Code!
   See the [DropletAPI](documentation/DropletAPI.md) for an introduction to some of the main functions you'll need to use, and [Common Problems](documentation/common_problems.md) for help debugging.

8. Compile and Upload  
   1. Plug your Droplet in.
   2. Click the green 'play' outline button in the top task bar, to the left of the drop-down menu which defaults to 'Debug'. 
      (Not the solid play button, which actually starts up Debug mode. When you mouseover the button, the tooltip should say 'Start Without Debugging'.)

Now just repeat steps 7 & 8 as necessary!
Good luck!

#### Fuse Settings
The first time you get started with a brand new Droplet, verify that the fuse settings are as follows

| Fuse Name     | Value         |
| -------------:|:------------- |
| JTAGUSERID    | 0xFF          |
| WDWP          | 8CLK          |
| WDP           | 8CLK          |
| BOOTRST       | APPLICATION   |
| TOSCSEL       | XTAL          |
| BODPD         | DISABLED      |
| RSTDIBL       | [ ]           |
| SUT           | 0MS           |
| WDLOCK        | [ ]           |
| JTAGEN        | [ ]           |
| BODACT        | DISABLED      |
| EESAVE        | [X]           |
| BODLVL        | 1V6           |

| Fuse Register | Value         |
| -------------:|:------------- |
| FUSEBYTE0     | 0xFF (valid)  |
| FUSEBYTE1     | 0x00 (valid)  |
| FUSEBYTE2     | 0xFF (valid)  |
| FUSEBYTE4     | 0xFF (valid)  |
| FUSEBYTE5     | 0xF7 (valid)  |

#### Serial Communication

The Droplets are capable of serial communication with a computer. Primarily, we use this to view print statements from the Droplets, and occasionally to override their code for debugging purposes.

#### FTDI Cable

The Sparkfun FTDI cable comes with six cables. We just need four. Specifically:
Black (GND)
Orange (RX)
Yellow (TX)
Red (5V)
So I get an empty 4 pin female connecter and use tweezers to remove the crimped ends from the 6 pin connector and insert them in to the 4 pin connector.
